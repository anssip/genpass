A password manager for the command line. Syncs with the Keychain.

USAGE:
    passlane [OPTIONS]

OPTIONS:
    -c, --csv <CSV>      Import credentials from a CSV file
    -g, --grep <GREP>    Grep passwords by service
    -h, --help           Print help information
    -k, --keychain       Sync credentials to Keychain. Syncs all store credentials when specified as
                         the only option. When used together with --save, syncs only the password in
                         question
    -m, --master-pwd     Update master password
    -s, --save           Save the last generated password
    -v, --verbose        Verobose: show password values when grep option finds several matches
    -V, --version        Print version information
```

### Generate a new password

- Sign up for a new service in the web browser
- Run `passlane` --> gnerates and saves a new password to the clipboard
- Use the generated password from the clipboard
- After successful signup: Open terminal and run `passlane -s` to save the password

### Using saved credentials

Later on, when logging in to foobar.com:

- Run `passlane -g foobard.com` --> copies foobar.com's password to clipboard.
- Use the password from clipboard to login

_or alternatively_

- Let MacOS propose the saved password. It knows it because Passlane also syncs to the keychain.

### Syncing with the system Keychain

Passlane uses the [keyring crate](https://crates.io/crates/keyring) to sync credentials to the operating system's keychain. Syncing should work on Linux, iOS, macOS, and Windows.

Use option `-s` together with `-k` to save the last generated password to the Passlane storage file _and_ to the keychain:

```
passlane -s -k
```

To sync all Passlane stored options to the keychain use the `-k` option alone:

```
passlane -k
```

### Migrating from 1Password, LastPass, Dashlane etc.

You can import credentials from a CSV file. With this approach, you can easily migrate from less elegant and often expensive commercial services.

First, make sure that the CSV file has a header line (1st line) with the following column titles:

- username
- password
- service

The `service` field is the URL or name of the service. When importing from Dashlane, the only necessary preparation is to rename `url` to `service`.

To export the credentials to a CSV file and import the file into Passlane:

```bash
passlane --csv <path_to_csv_file>
```

Here are links to instructions for doing the CSV export:
